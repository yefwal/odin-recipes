    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Shoyu (醤油) means soy sauce in Japanese. Shoyu ramen simply refers to
      ramen served with a soy sauce-based broth that is usually in clear, brown
      color. It is one of the three main types of ramen categorized by broth
      flavors. If you’re in Tokyo, shoyu ramen is the most familiar form of
      ramen you’ll find. To make a good bowl of ramen is an art form itself.
      Ramen chefs pull together different elements to define the bowl of
      noodles. Even the simplest of ramen requires close attention to the
      ingredients, be it the broth or noodles, making sure each one interacts
      harmoniously. But, please don’t let this stop you from making ramen at
      home. As long as you have a well-stocked Japanese/Asian pantry, it is
      possible to whip up a decent ramen at home. The beauty of homemade ramen
      is you get to control what’s in the soup!

    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the toppings AHEAD OF TIME. Both Chashu and Ramen Egg should be
        made the previous day. This way, on the day of serving ramen, you just
        need half an hour to put it together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the soup. Combine all the soup broth ingredients and let it
        simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the ramen noodles and assemble the ramen. Make sure you cook the
        noodles just al dente because the hot broth will continue to cook the
        noodles. Drain and divide into individual ramen bowls. Pour the soup
        broth and add the toppings to the ramen.
